# Spring-Boot-App-to-Kubernetes-using-Minikube

**🌟 ## Overview**
In this project, I’ll walk you through how I containerized a simple Spring Boot application and deployed it to a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. This hands-on project helped me understand how real-world microservices are deployed using Kubernetes and gave me practical exposure to core DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Java Spring Boot
- Docker
- Kubernetes + Minikube
- Maven

**⚙️ Step-by-Step: How This Project Was Built**

✅ 1. Create a Spring Boot Application
A basic REST API was created using Spring Boot with a simple Hello, Kubernetes! endpoint.
✅ 2. Containerize the App with Docker
The Dockerfile builds a Docker image from the Spring Boot app.
✅ 3. Set Up Minikube & Kubernetes:
Use Minikube’s Docker daemon to make images available inside the cluster
✅ 4. Create Kubernetes Deployment & Service
deployment.yaml creates Pods from the Docker image.
service.yaml exposes the app via a ClusterIP service.
